
FWG quick fsx file viewer
=========================

In order to properly service our customers we have decided to collect important documents into a shared FSX folder. To make life easier for our advisors when browsing these files we want to provide a custom file interface to view and search these files.

Complete the stories in order to build a basic file browser. Please note there is no expectation that you will complete all of these tasks, this exercise is meant to show how you approach the problem.

**As a** FWG Customer advisor 

**I want** to display the customer documents filesystem

**So that** I can more readily browse customer documents

Create a file system tree layout front end which:

- displays the file system layout with files and folders
- shows me the file or folder name 
- shows me the date created
- shows me the file type

customer files should be ordered alphabetically

**As a** FWG Customer advisor 

**I want** search for customer by name, while also filtering by tag

**So that** I can find exactly the customer I am looking for
